### Software Engineer | Backend & Cloud Systems

I am a software engineer who builds scalable, high-performance applications. I believe the best products are built on a foundation of fast, reliable, and scalable systems a principle I applied while working on core reliability challenges at **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**. My expertise lies in the full software development lifecycle, using **Java** and **Python** to build everything from backend microservices and automated data pipelines to full-stack applications.

### Featured Projects

#### 1. [AI-Powered Document Q&A Service](https://github.com/Hrishank07/AI-Powered-Document-Q-A-Service)
*   **What it does:** An intuitive, AI-powered service that allows users to upload documents, ask natural language questions, and receive precise, source-cited answers.
*   **How it's built:** The backend is a fully serverless, event-driven architecture on **AWS**, leveraging **Bedrock** for the RAG pipeline and **Lambda** for business logic. The entire infrastructure is defined as code using **Terraform** and containerized with **Docker** for consistency.

#### 2. [Full-Stack 2FA Security Service](https://github.com/Hrishank07/your-repo-link-here)
*   **What it does:** A critical security feature developed to protect an internal enterprise platform, introducing two-factor authentication (2FA) and role-based access controls (RBAC) to prevent unauthorized access for over 500 users.
*   **How it's built:** A **full-stack application** built using a **MEAN stack** (**Node.js** for the backend REST API, **Angular** for the frontend), with **MSSQL** serving as the primary relational database.

#### 3. [Serverless Resume Analysis API](https://github.com/Hrishank07/Resume-Optimization-Service)
*   **What it does:** An automated tool for job seekers that provides on-demand analysis of their résumé against a job description, offering suggestions to improve its chances of passing through Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS).
*   **How it's built:** The service is exposed via a **RESTful API** built with **API Gateway** and **Lambda**, using **OpenAI's** GPT models for the core NLP tasks. The entire deployment is automated with **Terraform** for rapid, repeatable setup.
